        <h2>About</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>What is the Benign virus project? the Benign virus project is a class assignment to make a benign powershell script</p>
            <p>it is not <i>actually a virus (or other malware)</i> but it does try it's best to annoy the user.</p>
            <p>the project is largely supported by the SAPIEN Powershell Studio evalation trial. though minor edits have been done using Visual Studio Code.</p>

        <h2>Why is this project on Github?</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>this project is on Github likely for source and version control, <i>BUT</i> I also hope to use it to guage how much I have learned in the future from now.</p>
            <p>I also plan to use this project as a base when I do eventually pursue certificates related to malware development (ethical development) of course from sources such as <a href="https://maldevacademy.com/">maldevacademy</a></p>
        </ol>
