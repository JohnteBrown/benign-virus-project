        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page provides a little bit of context on why this project exists
          much less why it is public
        </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <ol>
          <p>
            What is the Benign virus project? the Benign virus project is a
            class assignment to make a benign powershell script
          </p>
          <p>
            it is not <i>actually a virus (or other malware)</i> but it does try
            it's best to annoy the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            the project is largely supported by the SAPIEN Powershell Studio
            evalation trial. though minor edits have been done using Visual
            Studio Code.
          </p>

        <h2>Why is this project on Github?</h2>
        <ol>
          <p>
            this project is on Github likely for source and version control,
            <i>BUT</i> I also hope to use it to guage how much I have learned in
            the future from now.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also plan to use this project as a base when I do eventually
            pursue certificates related to malware development (ethical
            development of course) from sources such as
            <a href="https://maldevacademy.com/">maldevacademy</a>

        <p>
          Refer to the <code>README.md</code> file for the contributor code of
          conduct and other useful information
          <strong>please keep in mind the README is currently a WIP</strong>

        <h2>Why are there so many comments?! did you use AI?!</h2>
        <ol>
          <p>
            Did I use AI? I wrote my Script largely by hand but Yes I will not
            lie I did use AI but only for debugging & understanding the IDE I
            was using for the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI's use was very limited and during prompts I specifically asked it
            to explain RATHER than to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comments found in the packaged version of the script or any included
            modules are likely written by me or autogenerated. additionally some
            comments may be simple notes or debug information made by any AI LLM
            tools used alongside the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            if further proof is needed please feel free to check the git commit
            history & git metadata found in the local .git project folder.
